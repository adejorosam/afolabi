                <p></p>
            "If you would have told me five years ago that I would be in full time ministry,I would have asked if you<br> were talking to the right person." Sarah said.<br>
<p></p>              
            At twenty-three years old she was tempted to allow her journey as a woman battling insecurities, teen <br> pregnancy stigma, low self-esteem, toxic relationships, and depression to define the rest of her life. It <br>wasn't until she was in her darkest moment that she realized she only had two options: settle or evolve.<br> Sarah dared to harness the wisdom of her past wounds and apply them to the hope for her future.<br>
            <p></p>
            The process of transforming from the insecure and fearful young girl that she was into the powerhouse <br> wife, mother, businesswoman, and leader that she is took dedication, discipline, resources, and spiritual <br> growth. Her passion is to utilize her experiences, insight, and influence to help every soul she <br>encounters to evolve into the best version of themselves. <br>
            <p></p>
         
    <h6 class="dem" style="font-size: 16px;">  In 2017, Sarah launched Woman Evolve a ministry that focuses on incubating every woman to her fullness.<br> Since its conception Woman Evolve has been successful at reaching and guiding thousands of women<br> to awaken healing, wholeness, and love for themselves and others.  <br>To learn more about ways that you can get involved with the Woman Evolve movement click here. <br>
